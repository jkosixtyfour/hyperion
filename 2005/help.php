<span class="highlight">Q: How can I share my videos and link to them from my website?</span>

<br><br>A: <a href="sharing.php">How to share and link to your videos</a>
<br/>
<br/>

<span class="highlight">Q: What kind of videos can I upload?</span>

<br><br>A: You may upload any kind of personal video that you'd like to share with the world. We don't allow any nudity and your video must be appropriate for all audiences. 
<br/>
<br/>
However, this still leaves a lot of room for creativity!! Do you own a <a href="results.php?search=dog">dog</a> or a <a href="results.php?search=cat">cat</a>? Have you gone on vacationing in <a href="results.php?search=mexico">Mexico</a>? Do you live in <a href="results.php?search=netherlands">The Netherlands</a>?
<br/>
<br/>
These are just some examples of the videos that our users are uploading. In the end, you know yourself best. What would <i>you</i> like to capture on video?

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How long can my video be?</span>

<br><br>A: There is no time limit on your video, but the video file you upload must be less than 100 MB in size.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What video file formats can I upload?</span>

<br><br>A: Hyperion accepts video files from most digital cameras and from cell phones in the .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG file formats.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How can I improve my videos?</span>

<br><br>A: We encourage you to edit your videos with software such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050829225913/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx" target="_blank">Windows MovieMaker</a> (included with every Windows installation), or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050829225913/http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/" target="_blank">Apple iMovie</a>. Using these programs you can easily edit
your videos, add soundtracks, etc.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: Do I retain copyrights and other legal rights to my videos?</span>

<br><br>A: Yes. You retain all rights to your content. Hyperion assumes no copyright to your material. 

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What is your policy on copyright infringement?</span>

<br><br>A: Hyperion respects the rights of copyright holders and publishers and is only accepting video uploads from persons who hold all necessary rights to the uploaded material. Our policy is to respond to any notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that content you submitted infringes another party's copyright, your account may be terminated and the video removed from Hyperion. 

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How do I report copyright infringement?</span>

<br><br>A: If you believe that someone else has uploaded your copyrighted content without your permission, we encourage you to contact that person in order to resolve any differences with them directly.  You can also contact our support team using this <a href="contact.php">form</a> for instructions on how to submit a copyright infringement notice to Hyperion.

<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?</span>

<br><br>A: We'll let you know if we receive a copyright complaint about any of your video content that is hosted on Hyperion. We'll give you the opportunity to respond appropriately.<br>

<br><span class="highlight">Q: What are you doing to prevent content that violates your policies from appearing in Hyperion?</span>

<br><br>A: We do a preliminary review on uploaded videos through both a manual and automated process. Although we try our best to detect and remove videos that violate our policy guidelines, our review process is primarily focused on removing adult content or obvious copyright violations, and is not bulletproof. However, we encourage our viewers to notify us when they discover policy violations or copyright issues -- we have a process for reviewing reported policy violations, and respond to reported copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

<br><br>If you have any account or video issues, please contact us <a href="contact.php">here</a>.
Also, if you have any ideas or suggestions to make our service better, please don't hesitate to drop us a line.
